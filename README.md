# Matplotlib-Graphing-Bot
A graphing bot which allows one to generate 7 types of graphs including scatter plots and overlapping histograms.

First made this bot in 2019 and have been upgrading it since then. To use it, dump data into the data.txt file and run the main.py file.
Whilst having interesting features (for e.g. stacked histograms and donut charts), it's hard for anyone apart from myself to use at the moment. 

Will make it easier to use during the Dec hols at the end of the year :D
